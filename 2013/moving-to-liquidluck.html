        <p>Been a while since I've been active. I've been procrastinating writing
new stuff because it was such a pain to write all my posts in pure HTML.
I needed something better, so I could focus on the content, rather than
worrying about the HTML tags. I needed a nice little framework, which
would let me write, and handle CSS, colors and links for me.</p>
<p>Now for most people, Wordpress would suffice. Actually, it won't just
suffice, people will start loving it. It has just about everything a blogger
would want. Tags, themes, comments, plugin extensions, you name it and
it's there. But with that comes a load of bloat. Plus I didn't want
something that's PHP based. (I've got nothing against PHP, but it just
<a class="reference external" href="http://phpsadness.com/">doesn't seem very elegant</a>).</p>
<p>I went through a few other blogging platforms, and ended up liking
none of them. Basically, I needed these features in my framework:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Support for posts in Markdown or reStructuredText</li>
<li>Easy deployment (should take less that 3 minutes)</li>
<li>Extensible</li>
<li>Good theme support</li>
</ul>
<p>Static blog generators did fit the bill well. The added advantage of
static generators is that I don't need a hi-fi server to host my website.
There's an insane amount of choice when it comes to static website
generators. We have them in Ruby, Python, Java and there's even one <a class="reference external" href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">in
Haskell</a>. A quick search on GitHub shows
159 repositories. You might also want to check out the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pinceladasdaweb/Static-Site-Generators">list of static
website generators</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize, there are a lot of static website generators. And it's
really hard to choose one. After trying to work with Jekyll, Hyde,
Tinkerer, Pelican, Obraz, Poole, Acrylamid, I finally came across <a class="reference external" href="http://lab.lepture.com/liquidluck/">Felix
Felicis</a>. What attracted me about it (apart from the name!) is that it
is extremely easy to search for, install and modify themes. I am
currently using a sort of modified version of the default theme.</p>
<p>I'll do a short write up on how to set everything up in my next post.
However, the <a class="reference external" href="http://liquidluck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">documentation</a> is really worth checking out.</p>
